## Introduction

Recognizing architectural styles and landmarks is a challenging endeavor in the realm of computer vision, especially with limited datasets. This project focuses on addressing these challenges and classifying images into 6 distinct architectural styles and 30 specific landmarks.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises images from:
- 6 architectural styles: Gothic, Modern, Mughal, Neoclassical, Pagodas, and Pyramids.
- 30 landmarks, with 5 landmarks per style.
- Each landmark consists of 14 images, underscoring the challenge of working with a limited dataset.

## Methodology

1. **Transfer Learning with VGG16:** The pre-trained VGG16 model was fine-tuned by adjusting specific layers for adaptability to our classification tasks.
2. **Data Augmentation:** Techniques such as rotation, width and height shift, zoom, and horizontal flipping were employed to artificially expand the dataset.
3. **Multi-output Model Strategy:** Designed a two-branch model â€“ one for category (style) classification and another for landmark identification.

## Results

- **Category Classification:** Achieved an F1 score of 0.9640 and a recall score of 0.9642.
- **Landmark Classification:** Secured an F1 score of 0.8638 and a recall score of 0.8690.
